INTRODUCTION
------------

Views Tools is very useful and comes handy with the following features:

1: Backup of a View(export a single view to YAML).
2: View display(s) can be exported to a new view.
3: A single display can be saved as new View.
4: Displays can be deleted without loading the whole view.

To use this goto Structure >> Views Tools.

TODO :
We do have planned for another set of features to be implemented.
1: Editing views display directly though database.
2: Editing only selected views display without worrying about override options.
